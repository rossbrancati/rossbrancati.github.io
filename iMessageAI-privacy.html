									<h4>PRIVACY POLICY FOR MESSAGEAI</h4>

									<h4>Last updated: February 11, 2026

										Ross Brancati ("we," "our," or "us") operates the messageAI
										iMessage application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains
										how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use
										our App. </h4>

									<h4>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h4>

										<h4>Account Information:
										When you create an account, we collect your email address
										through Firebase Authentication. This is used solely for
										account creation, login, and linking your subscription data.</h4>

										<h4>Usage Data:
										We store your subscription tier, message count, and image
										generation count in Google Firebase Firestore to enforce
										monthly usage limits. This data is linked to your account
										and is not shared with third parties.</h4>

										<h4>User-Generated Content:
										When you use the chat or image generation features, your text
										prompts and uploaded images are sent to the Google Gemini API
										for processing. This content is transmitted in real time and
										is not stored on our servers. Please refer to Google's privacy
										policy for information on how Google handles data processed
										through the Gemini API.</h4>

										<h4>Analytics and Crash Reporting:
										We use Firebase Analytics and Firebase Crashlytics to collect
										anonymous usage statistics and crash reports. This helps us
										understand how the App is used and improve its stability.
										Analytics data includes events such as messages sent, images
										generated, and subscription purchases. Crash reports may
										include device type, operating system version, and
										anonymized stack traces. No personally identifiable
										information is included in analytics or crash data.</h4>

										<h4>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION:

										<h4>- To provide and maintain the App's functionality</h4>
										<h4>- To manage your account and subscription</h4>
										<h4>- To enforce usage limits based on your subscription tier</h4>
										<h4>- To process your chat messages and image generation requests
										  through the Google Gemini API</h4>
										<h4>- To improve the App through anonymous analytics</h4>
										<h4>- To diagnose and fix crashes and technical issues</h4>

										<h4>DATA SHARING:
										We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to
										third parties. Your data is shared only with the following
										service providers, solely for the purposes described above:</h4>

										<h4>- Google Firebase (authentication, database, analytics, crash
										  reporting)</h4>
										<h4>- Google Gemini API (AI text and image processing)</h4>
										<h4>- Apple (in-app purchase and subscription management)</h4>

										<h4>These service providers have their own privacy policies
										governing their use of your data.</h4>

										<h4>DATA RETENTION:
										Your account information and subscription data are retained
										as long as your account is active. Chat messages and image
										prompts are not stored on our servers and exist only during
										the active API request. You may request deletion of your
										account and associated data at any time by contacting us at
										the email address below.</h4>

										<h4>DATA SECURITY:
										We use industry-standard security measures to protect your
										data, including encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS), Firebase
										security rules that restrict data access to authenticated
										users, and server-side API key management.</h4>

										<h4>HILDREN'S PRIVACY:
										The App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We
										do not knowingly collect personal information from children
										under 13. If we become aware that we have collected data from
										a child under 13, we will take steps to delete it.</h4>

										<h4>YOUR RIGHTS
										You have the right to:</h4>
										<h4>- Access the personal data we hold about you</h4>
										<h4>- Request correction of inaccurate data</h4>
										<h4>- Request deletion of your data</h4>
										<h4>- Withdraw consent for data processing</h4>

										<h4>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at the
										email address below.</h4>

										<h4>CHANGES TO THIS POLICY:
										We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will
										notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy
										within the App or on this page. Changes are effective
										immediately upon posting.</h4>

										<h4>CONTACT US:
										If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please
										contact us at ross.brancati@gmail.com</h4>
