									<h2>Project Summary</h2>
									<p>Running is one of the most popular and effective forms of physical activity with numerous benefits to cardiovascular system health. However, about half of all recreational runners experience an injury each year (Kakouris et al., 2021). Patellofemoral pain (PFP), informally known as runner’s knee, is one of the most common running related injuries (Callaghan & Selfe, 2007) and is responsible for significant healthcare related costs (Afzali et al., 2018; Young et al., 2021). While the etiology of PFP is complex (Willy et al., 2019), it is well known that individuals experience biomechanical and neuromuscular adaptations at, distal to, and proximal to the patellofemoral joint(Powers et al., 2017). Although a great deal of work has gone into researching these adaptations and developing interventions to restore healthy movement patterns, patient outcomes are oftentimes poor (Barton & Crossley, 2016; Witvrouw et al., 2014). This can lead to recurrence of PFP even in patients who initially respond well to an intervention (Sandow & Goodfellow, 1985), which is problematic because recurring (i.e., chronic) PFP is linked with patellofemoral osteoarthritis (Eijkenboom et al., 2018). Clinicians typically diagnose PFP by analyzing patient reported symptoms or leveraging imaging, but these diagnostic methods are not optimal as they are subjective and not always accurate (Willy et al., 2019). Additionally, once a patient has gone through an intervention, there is no standardized method of evaluating if it the biomechanical and neuromuscular adaptations are restored, which could contribute to recurring PFP. Currently, there are two major obstacles in this field – consistent diagnosis and methods to evaluate efficacy of interventions from a biomechanics perspective. </p>

									<p>To solve this problem, we will develop a predictive system for clinicians to diagnose PFP and evaluate the efficacy of their interventions in these patients using non-invasive wearable sensors coupled with machine learning models. Inertial measurement units, which measure linear accelerations and angular velocities, will be fastened to various segments of the body including the thigh, shank, and trunk. To develop a quality data driven predictive model, real data from individuals with and without PFP will be collected and fed into the model. Using fusion algorithms, we will couple structured clinical data with time series signals (Fiterau et al., 2017) to accurately diagnose PFP. Clinicians can then leverage this system to assist in diagnosis and assess if their intervention was effective at restoring biomechanical adaptations to prevent recurrence of PFP. We expect that those who are classified as healthy following the intervention will have a much lower probability of redeveloping pain in the future, thus reducing rate of recurrence. These goals will be accomplished through 3 specific aims:</p>

									<p>Aim 1: Characterize movement patterns during running gait in individuals with patellofemoral pain using IMU derived signals.</p>

									<p>Aim 2: Develop predictive models to accurately classify runners with and without patellofemoral pain.</p>

									<p>Aim 3: Test and validate predictive models on a group of runners recovered from PFP.</p>

									<p>This will be the first attempt at leveraging wearable sensors and predictive modeling to build a model that can diagnose PFP and evaluate the efficacy of interventions in this patient population. Since the pain associated with PFP often occurs during dynamic movements, it is important to consider approaches that measure adaptations in dynamic scenarios, as opposed to imaging or other static diagnosis procedures. We expect our system to have high accuracy for the diagnosis of PFP, which can then be translated to clinical work with real world patients. Once patients have gone through an intervention, clinicians can re-test their movement patterns to see if they have shifted towards a healthy state. This could provide a means for alleviating time, cost, and clinical burden associated with a very common running related injury.</p>
