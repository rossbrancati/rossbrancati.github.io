									<h4>TERMS OF SERVICE FOR IMESSAGEAI</h4>

									<h4>Last updated: February 24, 2026</h4>

									<h5>iMessageAI ("the App") is operated by Ross Brancati ("we," "us," or "our"). By downloading, accessing, or using iMessageAI, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</h5>


									<h4>DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE:</h4>
									<h5>iMessageAI is an iMessage extension that provides AI-powered chat conversations and image generation using third-party AI models. The App is provided "as is" and features may change over time.</h5>

									<h4>SUBSCRIPTIONS AND BILLING:</h4>
									<h5>iMessageAI offers the following subscription plans:</h5>
									<h5>- Free: Approximately 25 chat messages per month. No image generation.</h5>
									<h5>- Premium ($1.99/month): Approximately 300 chat messages and 15 image generations per month.</h5>
									<h5>- Pro ($4.99/month): Approximately 750 chat messages and 40 image generations per month.</h5>
									<h5>Usage limits are approximations based on average message and image sizes. Actual usage may vary.

									Payment is charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each billing period unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period at the same price.

									You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your Account Settings in the App Store after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription.</h5>

									<h4>AI-GENERATED CONTENT:</h4>
									<h5>Content generated by iMessageAI, including chat responses and images, is produced by third-party AI models and may not be accurate, complete, or up to date. You acknowledge that:</h5>

									<h5>- AI responses may contain errors or inaccuracies.</h5>
									<h5>- Generated images may not exactly match your description.</h5>
									<h5>- You are solely responsible for how you use AI-generated content.</h5>
									<h5>- AI-generated content should not be relied upon for medical, legal, financial, or other professional advice.</h5>

									<h4>ACCEPTABLE USE</h4>
									<h5>You agree not to use iMessageAI to:</h5>

									<h5>- Generate content that is illegal, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, or otherwise objectionable.</h5>
									<h5>- Attempt to reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble the App.</h5>
									<h5>- Interfere with or disrupt the App's servers or infrastructure.</h5>
									<h5>- Use the App in any manner that could damage, disable, or impair the service.</h5>
									<h5>- Circumvent any usage limits or access controls.</h5>

									<h5>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account if you violate these terms.</h5>

									<h4>ACCOUNT AND DATA DELETION</h4>
									<h5>You may delete your account at any time from within the App. Account deletion will permanently remove your user data from our servers. Deleting your account does not automatically cancel any active Apple subscriptions — you must cancel subscriptions separately through your Apple ID account settings.</h5>

									<h4>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h4>
									<h5>The App and its original content, features, and functionality are owned by Ross Brancati and are protected by applicable intellectual property laws. AI-generated content created through the App is provided for your personal use.</h5>

									<h4>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h4>
									<h5>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Ross Brancati shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages resulting from your use of or inability to use the App, including but not limited to loss of data, loss of profits, or service interruption.</h5>


									<h4>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h4>
									<h5>The App is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not guarantee that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful components.</h5>


									<h4>CHANGES TO TERMS</h4>
									<h5>We reserve the right to modify these Terms of Service at any time. Updated terms will be posted on this page with a revised "Last Updated" date. Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms.</h5>

									<h4>GOVERNING LAW</h4>
									<h5>These Terms of Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States, without regard to conflict of law provisions.</h5>


									<h4>CONTACT US</h4>
									<h5>If you have questions about these Terms of Service, please contact us at: ross.brancati@gmail.com</h5>
